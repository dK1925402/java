/*

In your Library class:

    book() method is declared as static, so you can call it directly using the class name Library.book().
    newspaper() method is not static, so you need to create an object of the Library class to call it.

In the main method:

    You first call the static book() method using the class name Library.book().
    Then, you create an object of the Library class (Library obj = new Library()) and call its non-static newspaper() method (obj.newspaper()).
    You also attempt to call the static book() method using the object obj, which is valid but not recommended because static methods should ideally be called using the class name.
    Finally, you print "Hello, world!".
